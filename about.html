    <h1>What is Riichi Mahjong?</h1>
    <img src="/images/about1.jpeg" alt="about1">
    <p>
      Riichi mahjong is a Japanese variant of the ancient Chinese game of mahjong. It is a tabletop game that is played by four players, with each player having a hand which they must try and complete to win points from the other players. It shares similarities with Rummikub, and card games such as gin rummy and poker.
      Riichi mahjong can be a fairly complex game for beginners to pick up. The aim of this guide is to teach enough of the key aspects and basics for someone who is new to the game to start playing on a computer client such as the Gamedesign Flash game, rather than to be a comprehensive guide to all the rules and edge-cases that exist in the game.</p>


    <h1>Game development history</h1>
    <img src="/images/about2.webp" alt="about2">
    <p>Mahjong overall is only a 100 year old game or so. Originating in China, the game managed to spread across the country, East Asia, and even to the United States during the 1920s. The riichi variant itself only started emerging in Japan after World War 2. The modern variant today begain in the 1960's, while the addition of red 5's started appearing in the 1980's.  </p>
    <br>
    <h2>Main differences</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The game of mahjong itself has numerous variations across the world, including an attempted standardization of "World Mahjong". Virtually every country in East Asia and the United States has a form of mahjong. While they all have the same general principles, they each have very distinct rule variations.

      Japanese mahjong features these major aspects of the game, that are not used in many of the other mahjong variants. Although, these are not unique to Japanese mahjong.</p>
